~~- figure out what to do after clustering and dim reduction, as its unclear as of now.~~

- maybe do k-means in a better way - select best of multiple iterations
- valide genes found in some way
- some plot ideas - k elbow, variance of genes chosen (already done), the cost function value corresponding to different k-means intitializations.
- updating readme nicely
